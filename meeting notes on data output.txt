often add new technologies to the model
 - electricity generation would be broken down by different categories, e.g. biomass, hydrogen

could have other outputs, such as economic output by sector

currently primary energy is broken into coal, gas, oil, renewables, hydro, but might want to break it into coal "with or without carbon capture", or "gas with or without carbon capture"

wouldn't want numbers in the names of things

using new output format
